# Comic-Subs
Subscribe to comics on various platforms (one user only)

The app generates an rss feed for various comics which you follow. It does this by page-scraping the series page, checking for new releases.

## How to Host

The Project is designed to be hosted on GAE, create a python instance and then deploy the code.

## Supported Platforms

The app currently supports the following websites:

 * comixology (all regions)
 * crunchyroll manga
 * Weekly Shonen Jump Free Section
 * Weekly Shonen Jump Digital Magazine.

Additional platforms will be implemented as I start using them.
